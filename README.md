Background  
This project aims to develop a fully functioning clone of the classic arcade game Space Invaders using the C++ programming language. The game will replicate the gameplay of the original, where a player controls a spaceship and defends against an invading alien fleet by shooting them down, with the goal of achieving a high score. This project is being undertaken because we wish to recreate a classic arcade game and make it playable on modern machinery.
 
 
Objectives 
•	Implement basic game mechanics: movement, shooting, and collision detection.
•	Design enemy waves and a progressive difficulty system. Integrate a score system and display lives/levels.
•	Create visually appealing 2D graphics using the SFML library.  Implement sound effects for shooting and explosions.
 
Scope
The Space Invaders project will be an excellent opportunity to apply advanced C++ skills and gain hands-on experience with game development. The final product will deliver a playable arcade game, demonstrating competencies in OOP, event handling, game physics, and multimedia integration. Additionally, the project can serve as a stepping stone for more complex game development projects in the future.



Monitoring and Evaluation  
Progress will be evaluated through milestone-based reviews. Each phase will be assessed for completion of tasks and feature functionality. At the end of the project, functionality tests will ensure all core mechanics work as expected. 
Result Indicators for Each Objective:
•	Player Movement and Shooting: Player spaceship can move and fire projectiles accurately with no input lag.
•	Enemy Waves and Movement: Enemy patterns are well-structured and increase in difficulty as levels progress.
•	Collision Detection and Scoring: Hits register correctly for both player and enemies, with an accurate and responsive scoring system.
•	Game Interface and Audio: Functional start menu, in-game UI showing score and lives, game-over screen, and appropriate sound effects for key actions.
•	Final Game Testing: Smooth gameplay, no crashes or major bugs, with compatibility across multiple platforms.
